## How it's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started this website with an image of a layout template and coded it from scratch knowing I wanted it to be for a Japanese restaurant. I had already built out a couple of other static sites at this point so I was feeling confident enough to add a seperate menu page and try some new design choices. I also wanted to add an image carousel but I had never tried anything like that before so I watched a couple of tutorials, coded along, tweaked some things to fit my needs, and *VOILA,* a beautiful image carousel. Not too shabby.

## Optimizations
Always keeping responsiveness in mind, I made sure everything looks good on desktop, mobile, and everything in between. I also noticed that the site was rather sluggish at first, so I compressed my image and video files. Much better.

## Lessons Learned
While building this site, I learned that I shouldn't be afraid of trying something new just because it looks complicated. This is the first site I've built that incorporates JavaScript, and I think the interactivity really adds a lot! It didn't take me long at all to follow a tutorial and now I know how to build something new that I can use in any future projects!
